# Spent 30 minutes looking into enabling this cop.
# It turns out that the case I want to test for isn't
# really handled well. Doubles and spies do not seem
# to bring the necessary state with them, which is what
# is required where I am using them to test when rotations
# fire for AvlNode insertion to maintain AVL property.

# A couple of things to note here:
# 1. Many of the example could be reduced in size. I noted in the
#    readme (years ago) that the project was over-tested, and probably
#    by a large amount. There is likely significant opportunity to
#    the number and size of tests. This will take more time than I'm
#    willing to spend at the time of writing.
# 2. Some of the tests are property tests, and those are going to
#    have as many lines as the object has properties. This cop should
#    be turned off for those specs.
