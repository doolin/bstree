# Spent 30 minutes looking into enabling this cop.

# really handled well. Doubles and spies do not seem
# to bring the necessary state with them, which is what
# is required where I am using them to test when rotations
# fire for AvlNode insertion to maintain AVL property.

# A couple of things to note here:
# 1. Many of the example could be reduced in size. I noted in the
#    readme (years ago) that the project was over-tested, and probably
#    by a large amount. There is likely significant opportunity to
#    the number and size of tests. This will take more time than I'm
#    willing to spend at the time of writing.
# 2. Some of the tests are property tests, and those are going to
#    have as many lines as the object has properties. This cop should
#    be turned off for those specs.
#
# TODO: define a reasonable length for specs, then figure out how to
#       rewrite into that length. This will be time consuming, and
#       probably worth writing up the thinking processes while the
#       work is being accomplished.

# This is another tough one. Property-style testing just needs to be
# exempted from the single expectation per spec. Many ot the other ones
# which are long resulted in incrementally implementing various algorithms
# on the data structure, and are surely overtested. However, it has often
# been the case with this code that "overtesting" produced an edge case
# which was not found with more cursory tests. So it's a balance.
#
# TODO: consider, as an exercise, how to greatly reduce the number of
#       expectations in longer specs, writing up the justifications for
#       each. This could be time consuming.
