# Binary search tree in c

Implementing a binary search tree in c is not an unduly
difficult project. Implementing one which is properly
engineered with test code, a useful API, which doesn't
leak memory is quite another thing.

This is an attempt at that other thing.


## TODO

* Stub out header and source files for node and tree, and
ensure everything compiles, and is reachable by the test harness.
