# Binary search tree in Lua

An exercise to learn more about Lua programming with my current
favorite data structure.

## Running the tests

The code is executed via the tests, which are run with Luarocks
`busted` tool. On MacOs, install Luarocks with homebrew:

- `brew install luarocks`

Then install and run busted:

- `luarocks install busted`
- `busted`

The size of the test suite could probably be reduced
to some analytically determined necessary and sufficiant size.
