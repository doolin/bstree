# Simple binary search tree in python

Python isn't my native language, so implementing a binary
search tree seems like an excellent way to get more familiar
with Python syntax.

## To do

* (DONE) Implement `add`.
* (DONE) Implement `collect`.
* (DONE) Implement `find`.
* (DONE) Implement `depth`.
* s/find/search/
* Clean up the conditional code in the Node class, make it more
  idiomatic Python.
* Use the python disassembler to see how it works.
