# Simple binary search tree in Ruby

This tiny little project came about as a result of a conversation
with a coworker, a self-taught programmer with a background in
Russian literature. We both agreed we needed to step it up a bit,
and binary search trees seemed like an excellent place to start.

## TODO

* Add  `node.key` and use value for some associated data object
* Create a simple data structure to store, subclass `Struct`
* Implement `find` to retreive a node's value

## References

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), because
  there's no shame in simply getting started however which way, and
  Wikipedia is free for everyone.
* [CLR]() Gold standard.
* [Skienna](), a very useful reference with readable exposition and a
  unique slant.
