# Binary search trees

This little repo is part of an ongoing project to compare
how data structures are implemented in various languages.

## Specification

The `Tree` data structure API:

* `add` provisions the tree.
* `find` returns a reference to a particular node in the tree.
* `collect` prints values in order to some container or stream.
* `destroy` (c/c++) cleans up memory.

## Implementations

As of 2016-05-08, parts of the API have been implemented in Ruby and C++.
