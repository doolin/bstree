# Binary tree in javascript

The code here is secondary to understanding how to engineer
some sort of javascript module. In this case, the structure
will be a very simple lib + spec.

## TODO

terribly strong in Javascript, so I'm sure there is a lot of
room for improvement.

* Rewrite `collect` to invoke an in-order traversal with a callback.
