# Binary tree in javascript

The code here is secondary to understanding how to engineer
some sort of javascript module. In this case, the structure
will be a very simple lib + spec.

## Installing

- install npm
- `npm install mocha`

## Updating

- `npm outdated`

## Testing

- `npm test`

## TODO

Lots and lots I'm sure. At the time of this writing, I'm not
terribly strong in Javascript, so I'm sure there is a lot of
room for improvement.

- Rewrite `collect` to invoke an in-order traversal with a callback.

- Clean up tree specs by deferring detailed examples to node spec.
- Refactor specs, shorten to necessary and sufficient.
