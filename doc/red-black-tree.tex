\section{Red-black tree}

The Red black-tree appears to have a reputation of being both ``the last word''
in binary search trees (outside of specialist literature) and a fearsome
reputation among programmers in practice. One might speculate this reputation
is founded on the red-black tree being about as complicated as any particular
undergraduate data structure. For whatever reason, it seems to come up on a
regular basis in those discussions on what programmers should or should not be
expected to be proficient in for job interviews. One camp holds that basic data
structures (i.e., reb-black trees, etc.) should be at a programmer's
fingertips, the other that book learning from 30 years ago is hardly relevant
for shipping code daily.

But we don't case about such things. Our interest is in the thing itself.
