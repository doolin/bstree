\abstract{A few notes on binary search trees and their implementations
in various programming languages.}



\section{Introduction}


The following topics will be discussed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Differences in implementations between programming languages.
\item How best to containerize, including pure tree node, tree wrapper with
node class, abstracting keys.
\item Theory and performance.

\end{itemize}



\section{Containerizing}

\subsection{C++ templating}

\subsection{C struct inclusion}

\subsection{Ruby module inclusion}

Not sure if this will work, but it would be cool to have a Ruby module which
adds binary search tree capability to any object. The methods would have to be
class methods.
