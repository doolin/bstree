Here are some ways to store the structure in text format:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write to nested json. This requires writing out from the top
down. Should be able to do this by converting to hash, then
writing to json. Reading in is the reverse. How to convert a
hash to a binary tree? Maybe this is where to use combinator.

\item CSV: does this require top down, or can it be done by traversing?
Does it require a parent pointer?

\item Yaml: how are references handled?
\end{enumerate}
