Online research for uses of binary testit{search} trees returns very few actual
use cases. Nearly all the writing on the topic is devoted to properties
of binary search trees (or binary trees in general), or why balancing the
tree is important. While explicit implementation of binary search trees does
not appear to be common, the data structure does appear to be commonly used
as a key-value store backing \texttt{map} and \texttt{set} structures
in various programming languages such as C++ and Java.

There is a considerable and useful amount of discussion
about binary trees in general, which is outside the scope
of this study.

One situation where both fast insertion and sorted order matter is
online sorting, where for whatever reason, incoming data needs to be
sorted for fast access requirements.
