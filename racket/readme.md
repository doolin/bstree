# Racket scheme (stub)

Installed a version of Racket via Homebrew which allows running scripts
from the shell. This is just a placeholder for some example code, which
is not binary tree and will get moved later.

## More...

Racket will work with VS Code apparently, which is great! A few things to ensure can be done:

- Run `raco`, ensure it's installed.
